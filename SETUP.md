Fill in the following details for your new app:

* __Application name:__ this can be anything, something like "Deskpro App" will do
* __Developer name:__ Your name or contact person
* __Developer URL:__ Homepage or documentation for your site or something that looks like a URL
* __Callback URLs:__ you can copy this from the linear settings tab in this admin drawer in Deskpro

Copy the __"Client ID"__ and __"Client secret"__ and keep them safe.

Next, head back to Deskpro and enter the Client ID and Secret into the app settings form.

To configure who can see and use the Linear app, head to the "Permissions" tab and select those users and/or groups you'd like to have access.

When you're happy, click "Install".
